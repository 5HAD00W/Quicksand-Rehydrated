# Quicksand-Rehydrated

Quicksand Rehydrated is a mod that adds, well... quicksand! It's a reimagining of the 1.7.10 mod *More Fun Quicksand Mod*, with more in-*depth* escape mechanics, and rebalancing to make the mod suitable for a Survival experience.


Down the line, we plan to add several companion mods:

- This mod \[Quicksand Core\] will serve as a modpack-friendly basis that adds the terrain-themed hazards and structures, along with Hunnibees, a bee-like NPC with which to trade.
- A companion mod \[Quicksand Rehydrated\] will include larger swaths of swamps, fantasy and otherwise, along with mobs capable of devouring the player. This may warp Vanilla gameplay more heavily than Quicksand Core.
- A Candy-world addon \[Quicksand Glac√©ed\] to create other dimensions and further expand Quicksand Rhydrated's optional content.


This mod is VERY early in development, and likely won't see a release for several months. However, you are free to contribute to the mod and watch its progress [in our Discord!](https://discord.gg/GNSHzK8fRa)
