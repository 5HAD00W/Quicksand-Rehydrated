# Quicksand-Rehydrated
A revival of the More Fun Quicksand Mod, bringing its messes, mobs and items up to modern versions and modern standards.

Plans include bringing back (almost) all of the previous quicksand types, mobs, and flesh pits and fauna, along with new plants, potentially more slimes, and better mechanics for all of the above. Plus, an alternate Candy dimension with actual rewards!


This mod is currently in VERY early alpha, VERY heavily WIP.
